#Difference between Azure AD and Azure Acitive Directory Domain?
    Azure AD is fully managed in the cloud, Azure Active Directory Domain is used to integrete on-premise AD with Azure

PIM = Privileged Identity Management
    Allows you to assign permissions permanently or time-based

#What are the different cloud deployment models?
    Public cloud, private cloud, hybrid cloud

#What are roles and why do we use them?
    There are 3 types of roles in Azure - Web, Worker, and VM. Web roles deploy websites, worker roles execute background tasks, 
    and VM roles are used to schedule tasks and other windows services and to customize the machine on which the web and worker role
    is running.

#What would you use to connect Active Directory Domain Services on premise to Azure AD?
    AD Connect
        -Offers synchronization services, AD Federation Services, Health monitoring

#What is a deployment slot?
    Stage environments - essentially a copy of the live environment that can be flipped to production

VIRTUAL MACHINES:

A - Basic 
    Basic version of the A series for testing and devlopment
A - Standard
    General-purpose VMs
B - Burstable
    Instances that can burst to full capacity of the CPU when needed
        -Stores credits during the time the CPU is not being fully utilized. Credits are used to burst the CPU.        
D - General Purpose
    Built for enterprise applications. DS Instances offer SSD storage
        -Dsv3 VM's are identifiable by the number following the D. Standard_D2_v3 has 2 cores with 8GB RAM. Standard_D4_v3 has 4 cores
        16GB RAM. D8 has 8 cores, 32GB, etc. Always a 1:4 ratio between cores and RAM.
E - Memory Optimized
    High memory-to-CPU core ratio. ES instances offer SSD storage.
F - CPU Optimized
    High CPU core-to-memory ratio. FS instances offer SSD storage.
G - Godzilla
    Very large instances ideal for large databases and big data use cases.

STORAGE:

#What is blob storage?
    Blob storage is a binary object. Think of it more as 1's and 0's rather than files. Used for storing large amounts of information.

What are the three storage account types?
    General Purpose v1, Blob account, and General Purpose V2. GPV2 is the main choice because it allows you to store bits of everything, where GPV1 only allows blob storage.

Blob Storage:  
    Access application data from anywhere, large amount of storage (images, videos, etc)
Files:
    Access files across multiple machines, jumpbox scenario for shared devlopment scenarios
Disks:  
    Do not need to access outside of the VM, lift-and-shift of machines from on-premise, disk expansion for application installs (need more harddrive storage, etc)

What is a block blob and a page blob?
    Block blobs are ideal for storing text and binary files, up to 4.75TB. Page blobs are efficient for read/write operations and used by Azure VM's, up to 8TB.

Storage tiers:
    Hot, cold, and archive. Hot storage is frequently accessed, cold storage is less frequently accessed, and archive is very rarely accessed. 

    POWERSHELL:

Check AzureRM version:
    Get-Module -Listavailable AzureRM

Check resource groups:
    Get-AzureRMResourceGroup
Create Resource Group:
    New-AzResourceGroup

Create new storage account:
    New-AzureRMStorageAccount -ResourceGroupName $resourcegroupname -name "StorageAccountNameYouWant" -location "northcentralus"
     -SkuName Standard_LRS -kind StorageAccountNameYouWant

List available services provided within a certain namespace offered by AzureRM:
    AZ provider show --namespace Microsoft.Compute --query “resourceTypes[*].resourceType”

Create a VM:
    New-AzVm `
    -ResourceGroupName "myResourceGroup" `
    -Name "myVM" `
    -Location "East US" `
    -VirtualNetworkName "myVnet" `
    -SubnetName "mySubnet" `
    -SecurityGroupName "myNetworkSecurityGroup" `
    -PublicIpAddressName "myPublicIpAddress" `
    -OpenPorts 80,3389

Install IIS:
    Install-WindowsFeature -Name Web-Server
    
Storage Containers are private by default, but can be adjusted to Blob or Container.
    Private has no anonymous access, Blob is anonymous read access for blobs only, and 
    Container is anonymous read access for containers AND blobs

SAS = Shared Access Signature
    It is a query string that we add on to the URL of a storage resource to inform Azure
    what access should be granted. 

    Can also be used as tokens granted at the account level or at a service level.
    #Encrypted, hash-based message authentication

Single Sign On:
    Provided by Azure AD Connect to allow users to sign on once locally and not be required to authenticate with Azure AD

Multifactor Authentication:
    Way of verifying I am who I say I am by requiring 2 or more verification methods
        -Password, cellphone, biometrics (fingerprint scanner, etc)

RBAC Built-in Roles:
    -Owner, full access to all resources, including ability to delegate access to others
    -Contributer, can create and manage all types of Azure resources, but cannot grant access to others
    -Reader, can view existing Azure resources but cannot perform any other actions against them 
    -Many other various roles for specific purposes (backup operator, automation operator, etc)
    
 AZ Domain Services should go in it's own subnet

Create Azure AD Domain Services:
    Create a new resource
    Search "azure AD" and create Azure AD Domain Services
    Work through configuration assigning resource groups, name, etc
    Assign vnet and choose the subnet created for Azure AD
    Configure manage group membership (to make changes to Azure AD)
    Click OK
    Configure DNS servers
    Join VM to Domain

B2B = Business to Business
B2C = Business to Consumer

B2C is a Cloud Identity Solution for Web and Mobile Apps
    Highly scalable to hundreds of millions of ID's
    Enables authentication for social accounts, enterprise accounts
        Ex: User downloads an application on their phone to verify them in Azure AD B2C, which then connects them to another app.

B2B allows you to collaborate with partners outside of your organization
    Users receive an email with confirmation link upon invitation. Imported users are "Azure AD External User Objects" whom have access
    to shared apps, resources, documents, etc. Partners access with their own credentials and get Enterprise-level security.
